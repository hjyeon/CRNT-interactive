        Introduction to ODE and its network architecture
      </h1>
      <p class="intro__dek">
        ODE or System of ODEs is a simple predictive model with well-known
        solvers that survived the test of time. It does not suffer from problems
        like well-posedness and is easy to craft and put as explicit formulas,
        compare to models like PDEs. Furthermore, there is a simple graphical
        network that can provide a deep insight into the model. One can
        architect the network to get a model, similar to the relationship
        between NN and its underlying archtecture. Recently, people discovered
        that its parameters can be learned from large data.
